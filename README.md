Question 14 and 15 , ch8 of Malik C++ book

14. Write a program that prompts the user to enter 50 integers and stores them in an array. The program then determines and outputs which numbers in the array are sum of two other array elements. If an array element is the sum of two other array elements, then for this array element, the program should output all such pairs. 15. Redo Programming Exercise 14 by first sorting the array before determining the array elements that are sum of two other elements. Use selection sort algorithm, discussed in this chapter to sort the arr

15. Pick 5 Lotto) Write a program to simulate a pick-5 lottery game. Your program should generate and store 5 distinct numbers between 1 and 9 (inclusive) into an array. The program prompts the user to enter five distinct between 1 and 9 and stores the number into another array. The program then compares and determines whether  the two arrays are identical. If the two arrays are identical, then the user wins the game; otherwise the program outputs the number of matching digits and their position in the array.
